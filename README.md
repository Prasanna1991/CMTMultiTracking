# CMTMultiTracking
The multi-tracking based on Consensus Based Matching. 

I have tried to simplify the process from whole bunch of codes from CppMT and added 
the multi-tracking feature. The system is not that robust but still, I like the concept of 
tracking using optical flow so played with it. 

To use it, you will require OpenCV and CMake.

If you have both of these, follow the steps: 
mkdir build
cd build/
cmake .
make

You will get the executable multitracking and then run it:
./multitracking
